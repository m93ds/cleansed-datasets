# cleansed-datasets
This Repository will host datasets which have been cleaned and processed by me.

While working on datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository, I often come across datasets in formats not suitable
for analysis right away.

The steps taken to clean them up are very simple and you can implement them yourself. However, I thought I would
share those datasets here as I've already fixed them and you can simply download them and save time.

All the datasets uploaded here will be in CSV format.
